# This is a minimum Travis install

The repo needs to be set up with the .travis.yml file and this file needs to contain the command for the test script. In this case it's $ make test.
Then you need to sign in to Travis: https://travis-ci.org/cybertraders/ci-test and run the build.
With every new commit, travis will automagically check the tests.
